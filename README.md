# Nuxt Minimal DevContainer Starter
 
## What is different from Nuxt starter?
This starter is based on the Nuxt starter and uses devcontainer for the development environment. So you don't need to install all the different node versions on your local machine.

You can use npm, pnpm or yarn to install dependencies. Sorry for the bun lovers.


Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev


```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build


```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

# yarn
yarn preview


```
